# 🔧 Badge Component & Investment Portal Fixes

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Badge Component Export Error** - FIXED ✅
**Problem:** `The requested module '/src/components/ui/Badge.tsx' does not provide an export named 'default'`
**Root Cause:** Badge component was using named exports but files were importing it as default export

**Solution Applied:**
- ✅ Fixed all Badge imports to use named imports: `import { Badge } from '../ui/Badge'`
- ✅ Enhanced Badge interface to support `children`, `variant`, and `size` props
- ✅ Added proper variant types: `primary`, `secondary`, `success`, `warning`, `danger`, `destructive`, `outline`
- ✅ Added size variants: `sm`, `default`, `lg`

**Files Fixed:**
- `client/src/components/ui/Badge.tsx` - Enhanced component interface and variants
- `client/src/components/admin/UserManagement.tsx` - Fixed import
- `client/src/components/wallet/TransactionHistory.tsx` - Fixed import  
- `client/src/components/admin/WithdrawalRequests.tsx` - Fixed import

### 2. **Investment Portal Shared Mock Data** - IMPLEMENTED ✅
**Problem:** Each user had different mock investments, making the demo inconsistent
**Root Cause:** Investment data was stored per-user instead of being shared

**Solution Applied:**
- ✅ Created shared mock investment database (`server/data/mockInvestments.json`)
- ✅ Enhanced `mockDataManager.js` to load shared investments for all users
- ✅ Real-time price updates using current crypto data
- ✅ Consistent portfolio across all users showing BTC, ETH, BNB, ADA, SOL investments

## 🚀 New Features

### **Shared Investment System**
All users now see the same investment portfolio with:
- **Bitcoin (BTC)**: $1,000 investment
- **Ethereum (ETH)**: $500 investment  
- **Binance Coin (BNB)**: $750 investment
- **Cardano (ADA)**: $200 investment
- **Solana (SOL)**: $300 investment

### **Real-Time Price Updates**
- ✅ Investment values update with current crypto prices
- ✅ Profit/Loss calculations based on live data
- ✅ Consistent performance metrics across all users

### **Enhanced Badge Component**
```typescript
// Now supports all these variants and sizes
<Badge variant="success" size="sm">Active</Badge>
<Badge variant="warning" size="lg">Pending</Badge>
<Badge variant="danger">Failed</Badge>
```

## 📝 Technical Implementation

### **Shared Mock Investment Structure**
```json
{
  "_id": "mock_investment_1",
  "userId": "shared", // All users see this
  "crypto": {
    "_id": "bitcoin",
    "name": "Bitcoin",
    "symbol": "BTC",
    "currentPrice": 43250.89,
    "image": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1/large/bitcoin.png"
  },
  "amount": 1000,
  "quantity": 0.023127,
  "buyPrice": 43250.89,
  "currentValue": 1000, // Updates with current price
  "profitLoss": 0, // Calculated in real-time
  "profitLossPercentage": 0, // Calculated in real-time
  "status": "active",
  "createdAt": "2024-12-01T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

### **Enhanced Mock Data Manager**
- `loadSharedMockInvestments()` - Loads shared investment data
- `updateInvestmentValues()` - Updates values with current crypto prices
- `getMockInvestments(userId, cryptos)` - Returns shared + user-specific investments

### **Investment Controller Updates**
- Uses shared mock data when database is unavailable
- Real-time price calculations for all investments
- Consistent portfolio summaries across users
