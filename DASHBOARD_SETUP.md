# Dashboard Setup Guide - Fix "Data Not Available" Issues

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**
The dashboard was showing:
- ❌ "Wallet data not available"
- ❌ "Portfolio data not available" 
- ❌ "No cryptocurrency data available"
- ❌ "No recent transactions"

## ✅ **What Was Fixed**

### **1. Redux State Management**
- Added missing `extraReducers` to handle async thunks in all slices
- Fixed wallet, investment, and crypto state management
- Added proper loading states and error handling

### **2. API Endpoint Issues**
- Fixed market-data endpoint routing conflict
- Corrected API paths in thunks
- Added proper error handling for all API calls

### **3. Data Loading**
- Dashboard now properly fetches all required data
- Added transaction history loading
- Fixed crypto data and market overview loading

## 🚀 **Setup Instructions**

### **Step 1: Environment Setup**
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp server/.env.example server/.env

# Edit server/.env with your settings:
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/crypto-investment-platform
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-long-random-string-here
JWT_EXPIRATION=24h
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
```

### **Step 2: Install Dependencies**
```bash
# Server dependencies
cd server
npm install

# Client dependencies  
cd ../client
npm install
```

### **Step 3: Seed Sample Data**
```bash
# Seed cryptocurrency data (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.)
cd server
npm run seed-crypto

# This will create sample cryptocurrencies with:
# - Current prices and market data
# - 24-hour price history for charts
# - Market cap and volume information
```

### **Step 4: Start the Application**
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start server
cd server
npm run server

# Terminal 2 - Start client
cd client  
npm run dev
```

### **Step 5: Create User Account**
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click "Register" and create an account
3. Login with your credentials
4. Your wallet will be automatically created when you access the dashboard

## 📊 **What You'll See Now**

### **✅ Wallet Card**
- Current balance: $0.00 (initially)
- Total deposited/withdrawn amounts
- Deposit and Withdraw buttons working

### **✅ Investment Portfolio** 
- Shows "Start your investment journey" if no investments
- Will show portfolio value and performance once you invest
- Active investment count

### **✅ Market Overview**
- Live cryptocurrency data (Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, etc.)
- Price charts with 24-hour history
- Market caps and price changes

### **✅ Recent Transactions**
- Shows "No recent transactions" initially
- Will populate when you make deposits/withdrawals/investments

## 🛠 **How to Add Sample Data for Testing**

### **Add Sample Wallet Balance**
Use the deposit feature in the UI or directly update in MongoDB:

```javascript
// In MongoDB Compass or shell
db.wallets.updateOne(
  { user: ObjectId("your-user-id") },
  { 
    $set: { 
      balance: 1000,
      totalDeposited: 1000
    }
  }
)
```

### **Add Sample Transactions**
Make deposits through the UI:
1. Go to Wallet page
2. Click "Deposit"
3. Enter amount and payment method
4. Submit

## 🔧 **Available Commands**

```bash
# Server commands
npm run server        # Start server with nodemon
npm run seed-crypto   # Seed cryptocurrency data
npm start            # Start server in production

# Client commands  
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Preview production build
```

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **Still Seeing "Data Not Available"?**

1. **Check MongoDB Connection**
   ```bash
   # Make sure MongoDB is running
   mongod --version
   
   # Check connection in server logs
   ```

2. **Verify Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # In server directory
   node -e "require('dotenv').config(); console.log(process.env.MONGO_URI)"
   ```

3. **Check Browser Console**
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Look for API errors in Console tab
   - Check Network tab for failed requests

4. **Verify Sample Data**
   ```bash
   # Check if crypto data exists
   cd server
   node -e "
   require('dotenv').config();
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');
   const Crypto = require('./models/Crypto');
   mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI).then(async () => {
     const count = await Crypto.countDocuments();
     console.log('Cryptocurrencies in DB:', count);
     process.exit(0);
   });
   "
   ```

### **API Errors?**
- Ensure JWT token is valid (logout and login again)
- Check server is running on port 5000
- Verify API routes are accessible
